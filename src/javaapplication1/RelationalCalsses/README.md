#### Implemented design patterns 
>
> - **Factory Design pattern** 
>     - uses Users class (the parent class) to create all derieved classes (student, admin and proff class)
> - **singlton Design pattern**
>     - creates a single instance of student arraylist and courses arraylist so that every add, update or delete occures to a single list
> - **Adpter Design pattern**
>   - this patterns makes it easy for *admin* class to deal with *course* class  
> - **observer Design pattern**
>   - this pattern is made to give a student an obtion *(if he/she wants)* to subscribe a cousre and the system will notify him/her when the coure is available to register
> - **strategy Design pattern**
>   - this pattern is implemented to seplefy the add, update and deleted query for the development team
> 
> *there is another version of this project* which is implementing the same patterns using **ArrayList** https://github.com/peterezz/collegeSystem.
